Create app for natural language processing with wails and sql database

## Use Wails to Develop and Build an App
1. Follow the installation instructions for ![Wails](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation)
2. Pick a method for app development for frontend
    a. Svelte (what I selected)
    b. Type Script
3. Leverage the logic provided by Dr. Miller to create a SQL database (https://github.com/ThomasWMiller/jump-start-sqlite/tree/main)
4. Once the database is created, it needs to be embedded in the Wails app
    a. Hat tip to Wes West for the suggestion. See his example code below:
